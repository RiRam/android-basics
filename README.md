### Halloween Card
<img src="https://github.com/RiRam/android-basics/blob/master/Images/halloweencard.png" width="144px" height="256px" align="left" /> My practice card from the "Make Your Own Card" prompt. I made a Halloween card, using a RelativeLayout with an orange background, two TextViews, and an ImageView in the center with a PNG image of a ghost. I removed the title bar from this app by setting `windowNoTitle` to `true` in the styles.xml file.
