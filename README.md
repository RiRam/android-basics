I made a Halloween card, using a RelativeLayout with an orange background, two TextViews, and an ImageView in the center with a PNG image of a ghost. I removed the title bar from this app by setting `windowNoTitle` to `true` in the styles.xml file.

The app consists of a RelativeLayout, one ImageView, and five TextViews.

### Court Counter
<img src="https://github.com/RiRam/android-basics/blob/master/Images/courtcounter.png" width="144px" height="256px" align="left" /> The sample project for lesson 2, created by following along with the tutorial. It consists of several nested layouts, a RelativeLayout and three LinearLayouts nested beneath it, with four TextViews and seven Buttons. The goal of the app is to count points in a game of basketball, and it allows free throws, 2 point, and 3 point shots to be scored, and you can reset the counts by pressing "reset" at the bottom".

### Pok√©Score
<img src="https://github.com/RiRam/android-basics/blob/master/Images/pokescore.png" width="144px" height="256px" align="left" /> Project 2 for the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree: Score Keeper App. I created an app to count the number of prizes in a standard game of the Pokemon Trading Card Game. A standard game starts with both players having 6 prizes, and prizes are taking in amounts of 1 or 2 depending on game conditions. The app consists of five Buttons and five TextViews. When a player reaches 0 prizes, the buttons disable and a winning message appears at the bottom, and the "Reset" button resets the prize counts to their original values of 6.
